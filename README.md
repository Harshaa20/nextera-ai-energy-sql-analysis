# NextEra Energy SQL Analysis

## What is this project?
This project analyzes historical stock market data of NextEra Energy
to understand how investor perception has changed over time.

Instead of predicting stock prices, the project focuses on risk,
stability, and long-term behavior using SQL.

## What data is used?
Daily stock data for NextEra Energy (NEE) from 1973 to 2026.
The dataset includes prices and trading volume.

Adjusted closing prices are used to reflect true long-term value.

## What questions does this project answer?
- How stable is NextEra Energy over time?
- Does it protect investors during market downturns?
- Does it behave more like infrastructure than a risky stock?

## How is the analysis done?
The analysis is performed using MySQL and includes:
- Daily return calculation
- Rolling volatility analysis
- Comparison of gains and losses

## What did we learn?
The results suggest that NextEra Energy has become more stable over
time and is increasingly treated by markets as long-term
infrastructure rather than a speculative asset.
